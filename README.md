# Student-Record-Inserting-System
Developed a desktop-based student record insertion system using Java Swing for the GUI and Hibernate ORM for database management. The application allows users to input student details, such as name and roll number, and store them in a PostgreSQL database. It includes error handling for empty fields and successful record insertion notification.
